Steps: 
1. Edit the example.env into .env. Fill in the fields. RCODE_ID is your r-code ID, which can be found on the bottom of your profile. the two other fields are your steam username and password.
2. Generate a virtual environment and enter it
3. Install from the requirements.txt
4. Run the python script. It should say something like
```
Successfully logged in
Strive token obtained for user: <your steam id> - <token>
```
It will wait a little bit and then close. that should mean you have gotten the replays successfully, so go to line 20 and comment that out, and proceed.
5. `cargo run`. This should install all the packages you need, attempt to get replays, and print them out. If you see alot of JSON get spit out after a little bit, that means success. 

If you need a new token, just run generate_token.py again.
